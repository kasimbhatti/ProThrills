Front-End code

We wrote our own server in Python which processes all client data and sends back the game updates to each connected client. It has been written to allow multiple players to connect to the game simultaneously, start a game with another player and play a turn-based game in real-time.

To test our server, we have written a basic rock,paper,scissors game which anyone can run from any network (doesn't have to be on the same device as the server or in the same LAN) and play the game. The server is open and running 24/7 allowing connections at any time.

We plan to integrate this server and client code with our 3DConnect4 game code to allow users to play a 3D version of Connect4 with any player around the world, increasing the community aspect in gaming.

Setup and run:
Download all four .py files and run the client.py file. Python3 needs to be installed on the device.
