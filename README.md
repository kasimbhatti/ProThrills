Download all 4 files, and then run the client file.

This game is a 3D version of Connect 4. It has been created completely in python, using an openGL wrapper for graphics control. The game allows a row and column number to be inputted (controls described in terminal when game runs), which will place the counter in the lowest layer which does not already have a counter in that row/column position. The aim of the game is no different form a normal Connect  game, except now, the game allows for Connect 4s to be made in 3 dimensions, making for significantly more interesting gameplay.

This game automatically connects you to another player who also runs the client file. These 2 players do not have to be on the same wifi or on the same machine. A player can join you from anywhere in the world. We think this is a great way to enhance gameplay, by virtually connecting you to someone else in the world, you are increasing the size of your community.

This game was intended to bring all th efun of a family connect 4 game, and virtually extend the range of players which can play with you. You could also get help with moves from your family and local community, in order to connect with them too.

This game was intended to bring fun to those that play it, so we hope that you do!
